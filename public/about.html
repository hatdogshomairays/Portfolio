<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I’m John Rey Telesforo, 20 years old, and I’m at a point in my life where I’m learning more about who I am and what I want for my future. 
  Each experience I go through helps shape my perspective, teaching me important lessons about growth, responsibility, and self-awareness. 
  I’m still discovering my strengths and passions, and I see this stage as a foundation for the person I’m becoming.</p>

<p>I value personal growth and try to stay open-minded, especially when facing challenges. 
  Not everything is clear yet, but I believe that uncertainty is part of the journey. 
  I’m learning to trust myself, improve little by little, and remain patient as I work through both successes and setbacks. 
  These moments push me to become stronger and more confident over time.</p>

<p>I have goals that motivate me to keep moving forward, even when progress feels slow. 
  I strive to stay focused, grounded, and true to my values while building a future I can be proud of. 
  With determination, hope, and a willingness to learn, I continue to grow into the best version of myself.</p>
